# Projects:
1. **STM32 RTOS Multi-Task System**

Description: Developed real-time multi-task system on STM32F405RGT6 using FreeRTOS and C programming language in STM32CubeMX and Keil C

Hardware: Open405R-C board, CAN modules, FM24CLXX FRAM, 2.8inch Resistive Touch LCD

My Responsibilities:
- Task 1: Implemented LCD display driver with touch screen integration and responsive GUI
- Task 2-2: Connected 2 CAN modules, configured CAN1/CAN2 for 500ms periodic messaging [Group_ID][Temperature]
- Task 2-3: Developed button monitoring, temperature sensing (ADC), and FRAM driver for data logging with timestamps
- Task 2-4: Built a dynamic display system for receiving CAN messages with a 3-second timed display
